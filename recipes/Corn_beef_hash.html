<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In my personal opinion corn beef hash is one of the best breakfastes. It always tastes the same which is good, even when it comes from a can. But today we will be making a <em>homeade</em> version of one of the best dish every made. Luckly it is quite simple to make and only requires several ingrediants.</p>
<h3>Ingrediants</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unsalted butter</strong>: Three tablespoons</li>
    <li><strong>Diced sweet onion</strong>: One cup</li>
    <li><strong>Minced garlic clove</strong>: One clove</li>
    <li><strong>Diced cooked corn beef</strong>: Two cups</li>
    <li><strong>Cooked yukon gold potaoes</strong>: Two cups</li>
    <li><strong>Horseradish</strong>: One tablespoon</li>
    <li><strong>Chopped fresh parsley</strong>: Two tablespoons</li>
    <li><strong>Black pepper</strong>: One eighth teaspoon</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Stir in the cooked potatoes and corned beef; gently mix together, spread out evenly in the skillet, then press down with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Let everything cook without stirring, allowing to brown, for about 3 minutes (use the spatula to take a quick peek underneath to make sure they’re browning, but also not burning.) Once browned, flip sections over to brown on the other side, pressing down again; cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add in the horseradish, parsley, and pepper and gently stir until combined.</li>
    <li><em>Enjoy</em></li>
